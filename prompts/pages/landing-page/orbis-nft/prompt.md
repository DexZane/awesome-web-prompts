# Orbis NFT Landing Page — Prompt

```
Create an NFT landing page called "Orbis.Nft" with 4 sections, using a dark space theme. The page uses video backgrounds served from CloudFront, a liquid glass UI effect, and a specific color/font system. Recreate it exactly as described below.

FONTS (Google Fonts)

Anton - Used for all headings and navigation text (aliased as font-grotesk in Tailwind)

Condiment - A cursive script used for accent/overlay text (aliased as font-condiment in Tailwind)

System monospace font (font-mono) - Used for body/description paragraphs

COLOR SYSTEM (Tailwind config)

Background: #010828 (deep dark navy blue)

cream: #EFF4FF (off-white, used for all text)

neon: #6FFF00 (bright green, used for accent cursive text and underline bars)

LIQUID GLASS CSS EFFECT

Applied via a .liquid-glass class. This is used on the navbar, social icon buttons, NFT cards, and card overlays:

.liquid-glass {
  background: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.01);
  background-blend-mode: luminosity;
  backdrop-filter: blur(4px);
  -webkit-backdrop-filter: blur(4px);
  border: none;
  box-shadow: inset 0 1px 1px rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1);
  position: relative;
  overflow: hidden;
}
.liquid-glass::before {
  content: '';
  position: absolute;
  inset: 0;
  border-radius: inherit;
  padding: 1.4px;
  background: linear-gradient(180deg,
    rgba(255,255,255,0.45) 0%, rgba(255,255,255,0.15) 20%,
    rgba(255,255,255,0) 40%, rgba(255,255,255,0) 60%,
    rgba(255,255,255,0.15) 80%, rgba(255,255,255,0.45) 100%);
  -webkit-mask: linear-gradient(#fff 0 0) content-box, linear-gradient(#fff 0 0);
  -webkit-mask-composite: xor;
  mask-composite: exclude;
  pointer-events: none;
}


TEXTURE OVERLAY

A full-screen fixed texture overlay sits on top of everything (z-50, pointer-events-none). It uses a /texture.png image with mix-blend-mode: lighten at opacity: 0.6, covering the entire viewport with background-size: cover.
